# Flashy

A Java with Maven program that combines the flashcard study technique with a pomodoro timer.


## Flashcards

Create, save, and import flashcards. Flashcards are sorted by topic, and topics are sorted by categories. Flashcards are saved in a file system in the root of the project using JSON.
Begin by selecting a topic to study, then shift through all the flashcards in the topic. If the flashcard is easy, you can click a button that will temporarily take
it out of the pool.
